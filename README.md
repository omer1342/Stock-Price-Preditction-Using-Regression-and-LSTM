# Stock-Price-Preditction-Using-Regression-and-LSTM
### Stock Market Value Prediction In Python Using Regression &amp; Classifiers and LSTM 

*Omer Hen*

This project focuses on the research and implementation of various regressors and classifier vs a neural network 
algorithm such as an Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on the topic of predicting stock market values. The subject matter is the performance and final 
ability (after being trained) of the different models to predict the close price of stocks.

To narrow things down, the algorithm will fixate on Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) for training and prediciton.
